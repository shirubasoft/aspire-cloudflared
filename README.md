# Aspire.Cloudflared

A .NET Aspire integration for [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/), enabling you to expose local services to the internet through Cloudflare's network during development and deployment.

## Features

- **Automatic Tunnel Creation**: Tunnels are automatically created via the Cloudflare API during local development
- **DNS Record Management**: DNS CNAME records are automatically created for your hostnames
- **Ingress Configuration**: Tunnel routes are automatically configured to point to your services
- **Aspire Dashboard Integration**: Monitor tunnel status directly in the Aspire dashboard

## Installation

Add the `Aspire.Cloudflared` project reference to your AppHost project:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="path\to\Aspire.Cloudflared.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Quick Start

```csharp
using Aspire.Cloudflared;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add your service (e.g., a simple nginx container)
var webApp = builder.AddContainer("web-app", "nginx", "alpine")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 80, name: "http");

// Create a Cloudflare tunnel
var tunnel = builder.AddCloudflareTunnel("my-tunnel");

// Expose your service through the tunnel
webApp.WithCloudflareTunnel(tunnel, hostname: "myapp.example.com");

builder.Build().Run();
```

When you run the application, Aspire will prompt you for:
- **Account ID**: Your Cloudflare account ID
- **API Token**: A Cloudflare API token with the required permissions

## Getting Your Cloudflare Account ID

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select any domain in your account
3. On the **Overview** page, scroll down to find **Account ID** in the right sidebar
4. Copy the Account ID value

## Creating a Cloudflare API Token

The integration requires a Cloudflare API token with specific permissions to create tunnels and DNS records.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to **My Profile** → **API Tokens** (or for account tokens: **Manage Account** → **API Tokens**)
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Select **Create Custom Token**
5. Configure the token with the following settings:

### Required Permissions

| Permission | Access Level | Scope | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| **Account** → **Cloudflare Tunnel** | Edit | Your Account | Create, read, and manage tunnels |
| **Zone** → **Zone** | Read | All zones (or specific zones) | Look up zone IDs for DNS records |
| **Zone** → **DNS** | Edit | All zones (or specific zones) | Create CNAME records for tunnel routes |

### Token Configuration Screenshot Reference

Your custom token configuration should look like this:

```
Token name: Aspire Cloudflared Development

Permissions:
├── Account
│   └── Cloudflare Tunnel: Edit
└── Zone
    ├── Zone: Read
    └── DNS: Edit

Account Resources: Include → Your Account
Zone Resources: Include → All zones (or specific zones you'll use)
```

6. Click **Continue to summary**
7. Review the permissions and click **Create Token**
8. **Copy the token immediately** — it will only be shown once!

### Verifying Your Token

You can verify your token works by running:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

A successful response will show:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

## API Reference

### AddCloudflareTunnel

Creates a Cloudflare tunnel resource that can be used to expose services.

```csharp
IResourceBuilder<CloudflareTunnelResource> AddCloudflareTunnel(
    this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,
    string name,
    int? metricsPort = null)
```

**Parameters:**
- `name`: The name of the tunnel (used in Cloudflare and as the resource name in Aspire)
- `metricsPort`: Optional port for the cloudflared metrics endpoint

**Required Parameters (prompted at runtime):**
- `{name}-account-id`: Your Cloudflare account ID
- `{name}-api-token`: Your Cloudflare API token with tunnel permissions

### WithCloudflareTunnel

Exposes a resource's endpoint through a Cloudflare tunnel.

```csharp
IResourceBuilder<T> WithCloudflareTunnel<T>(
    this IResourceBuilder<T> builder,
    IResourceBuilder<CloudflareTunnelResource> tunnel,
    string hostname,
    string endpointName = "http")
    where T : IResourceWithEndpoints
```

**Parameters:**
- `tunnel`: The Cloudflare tunnel resource to route through
- `hostname`: The public hostname for this route (e.g., `"api.example.com"`)
- `endpointName`: The name of the endpoint to expose (defaults to `"http"`)

## Complete Example

```csharp
using Aspire.Cloudflared;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Create a Cloudflare tunnel
var tunnel = builder.AddCloudflareTunnel("my-cloudflare-tunnel");

// Example 1: Expose an nginx container
var nginx = builder.AddContainer("hello-world", "nginx", "alpine")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 80, name: "http");

nginx.WithCloudflareTunnel(tunnel, hostname: "hello.example.com");

// Example 2: Expose a .NET project
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 5000, name: "http");

api.WithCloudflareTunnel(tunnel, hostname: "api.example.com");

// Example 3: Expose multiple services through the same tunnel
var frontend = builder.AddContainer("frontend", "my-frontend", "latest")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 3000, name: "http");

frontend.WithCloudflareTunnel(tunnel, hostname: "app.example.com");

builder.Build().Run();
```

## Deployment Considerations

### ⚠️ Important: Production Deployment

During **local development** (run mode), the integration automatically:
- Creates the tunnel if it doesn't exist
- Retrieves the tunnel token
- Configures DNS records and ingress routes

However, when **deploying to production** (publish mode), you must manually provide the tunnel token:

1. **Create the tunnel** (if not already created during development):
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel create my-tunnel-name
   ```

2. **Get the tunnel token**:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel token my-tunnel-name
   ```
   Or retrieve it from the [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) under **Networks** → **Tunnels**.

3. **Configure the token** as an environment variable or secret in your deployment:
   - The parameter name will be `{tunnel-name}-tunnel-token`
   - For example: `my-cloudflare-tunnel-tunnel-token`

### Why Manual Token for Deployment?

The automatic tunnel creation uses the Cloudflare API with your development credentials. In production:
- You don't want API tokens with broad permissions in your deployment
- Tunnel tokens are scoped specifically to running the tunnel
- This follows the principle of least privilege

## How It Works

### Run Mode (Local Development)

1. **Tunnel Installer** creates/finds the tunnel via Cloudflare API
2. **Tunnel Token** is retrieved and passed to the cloudflared container
3. **Route Installer** creates DNS CNAME records pointing to `{tunnel-id}.cfargotunnel.com`
4. **Ingress Configuration** is updated with routes from hostname to your services
5. **Cloudflared Container** starts and connects to Cloudflare's network

### Publish Mode (Production)

1. **Tunnel Token** must be provided as a parameter
2. **Cloudflared Container** starts with the provided token
3. **DNS and Ingress** should be pre-configured in Cloudflare (from development or manually)

## Troubleshooting

### "Zone Not Found" Error

This means the API token doesn't have access to the domain's zone. Ensure:
- The domain is registered in your Cloudflare account
- The API token has **Zone: Read** permission for that zone
- The zone is active (not pending)

### "Tunnel Token Not Available" Error

The tunnel installer hasn't completed yet. This usually resolves automatically. If it persists:
- Check the Aspire dashboard for installer status
- Verify your API token has **Cloudflare Tunnel: Edit** permission
- Check the logs for API errors

### DNS Record Already Exists

This is normal if you've run the application before. The integration will skip creating duplicate records.

### Tunnel Not Connecting

- Verify your API token is valid and not expired
- Check that the tunnel token is correct
- Ensure no firewall is blocking outbound connections to Cloudflare

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API tokens** to source control
2. **Use User Secrets** for local development:
   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:my-tunnel-api-token" "your-token-here"
   dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:my-tunnel-account-id" "your-account-id"
   ```
3. **Rotate tokens** if they may have been exposed
4. **Limit token scope** to only the zones you need
5. **Use account-owned tokens** for shared development environments
